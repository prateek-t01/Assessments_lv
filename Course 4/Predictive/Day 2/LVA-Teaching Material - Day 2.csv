Accuracy,Ratio Between Total Correct prediction to the total predictions,(TP+TN) / # of data points,"1 - 10
0 -90",,,
Recall - TPR,How well my model is able to predict +ve's out of all actual +ve's,TP/(TP + FN),FN - reduce,,FN - reduce,"FN,FP - reduce"
Precision,"Out of all the cases which are predicted as 1, how many of them are actually 1.",TP/(TP + FP),,FP - reduce,,
F1-Score,This is high when both precision and recall is high,2xPxR/(P+R),,,,
